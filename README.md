# 🌧️⚡️ bitCloud Frontend (using React⚛️)

Frontend for a storage service developed using React.js⚛️, Vite⚒️, and ChakraUI💅🏻.

This project is linked with the [bitCloud-Backend✨](https://github.com/pabloperezmoya/bitCloud-backend) repository.

During the development of this project, I gained a lot of knowledge in the following areas:

* React.js (including asynchronous API calls) 📞
* React Router 🚡
* Chakra UI (for quick and visually appealing prototyping) 💅🏻
* File Uploading 📁
* And more...

Feel free to check out the [bitCloud-Backend✨](https://github.com/pabloperezmoya/bitCloud-backend) repository for the corresponding backend implementation.
